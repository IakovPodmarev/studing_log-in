# Log-in system
## Website - authorization system implemented in PHP.
To authorize, you need an unused name, email and password in the database. There is a confirmation of the password, it is stored in the form of a hash. Queries were written and tested in MySQL. Authorization errors are displayed in the address bar using PHP via the "GET" method, there is validation via jquery, but I have not yet turned off errors in PHP.
